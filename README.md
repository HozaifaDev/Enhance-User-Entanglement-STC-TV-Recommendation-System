# STC TV Recommendation System

## Purpose
The STC TV Recommendation System aims to enhance user engagement by leveraging data analysis and forecasting techniques to provide personalized recommendations and improve viewing experiences.

## Overview
This project involves a series of steps to understand viewing patterns, forecast future trends, and develop a recommendation system to boost user engagement. 

## Steps

### 1. Explore Different Types of Analysis
I conducted various types of data analysis, including:
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizing historical data to understand past viewing behaviors.
- **Diagnostic Analysis**: Identifying reasons behind certain trends and patterns.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Using historical data to predict future viewing trends.
- **Prescriptive Analysis**: Offering recommendations based on data insights to influence future behavior.

### 2. Extract Valuable Insights
Key insights were extracted from the data to:
- Identify the most viewed programs.
- Understand viewing differences between HD and SD formats.
These insights helped in tailoring the recommendation system to better meet user preferences.

### 3. Apply Forecasting Techniques
I applied the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast future viewing trends. This analysis indicated a potential decline in viewing hours, highlighting the need for strategic adjustments.

### 4. Develop a Recommendation System
In response to the forecasted decline in views, I contributed to the development of a recommendation system. This system aims to enhance viewer engagement by suggesting programs that align with user preferences and viewing history.

### 5. Support Data-Driven Decisions
I translated the insights and forecasts into actionable recommendations. This enables stakeholders to make informed decisions that can improve the platform's performance and user engagement.
